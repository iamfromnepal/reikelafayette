        <h2>It’s so good to meet you.</h2>
        <p>If there’s one thing I’ve learned on my journey of creating Reiki Montreal journey it’s this:<br>
            The absolute best part of it has been the people I’ve met on the way. You’re now one of those people. Hi.</p>

        <h2>I’ll admit it –</h2>
        <p>When I started my healing journey back in 2010, I had no clue what I was getting myself into.</p>

        <p>I knew I was dissatisfied, lost, angry-restless and looking for an elusive “something more”, but beyond that? Or how to “stop feeling that way”? I had no clue. I was looking in all the typical places a 22-year old looks: school (a bachelors in psychology from a top University should help, no?), travels, (bad) relationships, crazy conversations at 3am with friends after nights out, self-help books, you name it...</p>

        <p>But the connection I was looking for? The real deal connection with myself? The one that feels like self-acceptance and inner peace and humor and joy and creativity and awe all rolled into one? That one was buried far underneath patterns of social anxiety, perfectionism, codependency, anxiety and depression.</p>

        <p>Luckily, as blocked as I was, there was always that tiny little intuitive voice guiding me.</p>

        <p>And in 2010 she said: “Sign up for this Vipassana 10-day meditation thing. I don’t care you don’t know what meditation is. Just do it.” </p>

        <h2>So I did.</h2>
        <p>… and I haven’t stopped since. Someone I met at that retreat told me about chakras, which led me to learn about the mind-body connection, which led me to learn about Reiki, which led me to start undoing those patterns of perfectionism & social anxiety, which led me to committing to an entire certificate in Energy Medicine, which led me to… You get the idea. </p>

                <li>No matter how stuck you feel, you too have that little voice of intuition inside of you. Maybe she even sent you here. Listen.</li>

                <li>The most gorgeous person who you can become is EXACTLY who you are – underneath the patterns that don’t work for you. Everything we do here at Reiki Montreal serves that purpose: Whether you feel stuck in the darkest of places or just need a little guidance, we help you become who you are.</li>

        <h2 class="h3 mb-2 mb-xl-4">Now, let me circle back.</h2>
        <p>I said I gained a LOT through my healing journey. I healed so much (perfectionism, social anxiety (mostly.), so much shame, self-doubt (also mostly), I move through periods of situational depression so much faster now, my creativity wounds, codependent patterns in relationship, and so much more…). I can honestly say I love myself. I found my voice. I live an incredibly creative life (creating courses is my jam!). I travel a good 4 months out of the year. I have an incredible solid relationship with my partner Sean (and we’re about to become parents for the first time!). </p>
        <p>… and yet… with all of that good stuff, I can still say that what’s been MOST fulfilling to me on this journey is the people I get to meet. There’s nothing quite like watching people radiantly, truly become who they are. That truly opens my heart, puts a big smile on my face and it’s why I do this work day in day out.</p>

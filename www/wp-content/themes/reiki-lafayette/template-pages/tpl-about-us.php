    <p>It’s so good to meet you.</p>
    <p>Each of us is wildly different. We have different stories, personalities, struggles and loves. But. At one time or another, we have all gone through our own healing journeys.</p>
    We’ve all had a moment (or two or twelve or five thousand) where we felt stuck, where we struggled, where we repeated patterns that simply didn’t serve us. We’ve driven ourselves crazy with overthinking and anxiety. We’ve loved, we’ve lost. We’ve grieved. We’ve failed and learned. We’ve closed up and been broken open again. We’ve cursed our sensitivity only to discover it to be a great gift.
    We get it.</p>
    <p> … and we’ve all, all, at one time or another had the courage and humility to say: “this isn’t working. I want help”. We’ve all made the bet that devoting ourselves to our healing would open us to what we yearn for most – a life full of love, connection, meaning & peace…</p>

            <li>Every healer is trained in Reiki, but our training and experience absolutely doesn’t stop there. Check out each individual practitioner’s page to learn more about their journey & credentials. (These include things like Masters in Neuropsychology, Bachelor’s of Social Work, Osteopathy Degrees & more. We’re not kidding around.)</li>
            <li>Every practitioner is mentored by Inge Broer, who has had the pleasure of leading over 2500 healing sessions (and teaching over 100 classes) in her 8 years as an energy healer.</li>
            <li>We all work for ourselves, set our own prices, keep 100% of what we charge and practice from different locations around Montreal. (If you’re asking how does Inge & Reiki Montreal make money then? I like your business mind & scroll down for the “business structure” section!)</li>
            <li>No matter what else we do, each session aims to also reconnect you with yourself, your intuition and your wholeness.</li>

<div class="container block-width-625 font-avenir font-300 font-size-lg pt-2 pb-3 mobile-px">
    <p>7 courses that empower you to become the energy healer you were born to be, one easy step at a time.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>These include: The Empowered Empath, Reiki I, II & III as well as The Energy Healing Toolkit, Chakra Journey and The Mindful Healer. Together they comprise the Reiki Certificate.</li>
        <li>Unleashing the energy healer in you is a multi-layered process that requires a multi-layered approach. Therefore, we weave in online resources with in-person experiences to best support you in uncovering who you already are and what you already know.</li>
        <li>Classes happen at different locations in the Montreal area.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Regularly-held community events, because there are times where healing is a solo adventure. There are times when it's decidedly NOT. </p>

        <p>
            <p>Let’s back up a little – I’d love to tell you the story of how Reiki Montreal was founded.</p>
            <p>It’s a dark weekday in December 2012. I’m staring at my old and slow iMac as if it’s a crystal ball that holds the answers to the deep uncomfortable question I’m asking myself: What am I going to do?</p>
            <p>I’ve completed my last class of my Energy Medicine certificate. As challenging as they were, I loved every second of the 525 hours I spent in class learning about energy, confronting my blocks and spelunking my depths. I grieve the end of it. I’m one year into my masters in neuropsychology and I struggle to admit to myself that I know academia will never really be for me.</p>
            <p>At this time, I’ve done case studies. I can apply to be part of a naturotherapy association and give insurance receipts to clients. The only question is: “Do I dare? Do I dare try to make this work? Do I dare make a living from something as tenuous and underground as energy healing?”. Truthfully, the answer is “no”. “No, I’m not passionate enough”, “no, I’m not good enough”, “no, I’m not healed enough”, “no, I don’t know anything about marketing or business”, “no, I don’t have a space to do it from”, “no”, “no”, “no”.</p>
            <p>… and then… as I’m staring into the abyss of facebook window open on my screen, I see the red dot of a notification. I feel relief at being pulled out of my anxiety-fueled reverie. I click. An event: “Looking for a massage therapist or energy healer to share a space on St-Joseph E.”. There is no reason for me to be notified. Except. Well. That was all it took. I replied. I visited. I got the space for 3 days a week… and I figured out the rest, turning my every “no” into a “yes”. In January, 2013 I started with a few “pay what you can” clients. In February, 2013 I started for real.</p>
            <p>The rest? Well… I continued saying one yes at a time, building Reiki Montreal step-by-step until I could fulfill the vision I’ve had for it all along which is what you see before you now.</p>
